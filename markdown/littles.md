title: Little Problem sets
...

All "Little" problem sets will be posted here as they are released (at least 34 hours before the deadline).

# Instructions

Little problem sets are typically due every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. These problems were selected to hopefully be solvable in one "sitting" of a few hours. Sometimes the key insights required might come more slowly for any number of reasons, so do still start these early, and be patient with yourself. Each problem set will primarily depend on recent lecture material.

# Policies

You may collaborate with up to 5 other people (i.e. a group of up to 6 total) when completing exercises. You collaboration must be [Whiteboard Only](/syllabus.html) You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.

# Deliverables

Unless otherwise indicated, each problem set will be submitted as a pdf on the [Assignments page](https://www.kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cs4102). We do not have a preference for how the pdfs are generated (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, pictures of handwriting are all acceptable) so long as what is submitted is legible, and you use the appropriate mathematical symbols when necessary (please use the equation editor if you're using Word).
