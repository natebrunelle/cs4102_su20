For communication about course content, [Piazza](https://piazza.com/virginia/fall2020/cs4102) is preferred to email.
For communication about personal circumstances, email or in-person visits are preferred.
If you email, include either "algorithms" or "4102" in the subject line to prevent your email from skipping the inbox and never getting read.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.


## Readings

There is no required textbook for this class. If you would like to consult a text to reinforce your learning, we recommend:

*Introduction to Algorithms*, Third Edition by Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0262033844).
UVA Library makes a digital version of our textbook [available online](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775).

Readings corresponding to each lecture will be posted on the course schedule.


## Lectures

We do our best to make lectures as valuable, engaging, and enlightening as possible for all
students. For a schedule of lecture topics, please see the [course webpage](schedule.html).
We will post all lecture materials (recordings, slides, documents, etc.) on the course
webpage, including video recordings of lectures. Be advised that there are occasional technical difficulties which sometimes cause the recordings to fail, in these situations we will post an equivalent recording from a previous semester.

Lectures will be held via [Zoom](https://virginia.zoom.us/j/95047118539)

## Workshops

Workshops are optional and intended to reinforce lecture content through thorough discussion of example problems. These might include mathematical derivations of topics mentioned in class, example proofs similar to those you might see in your exercises, or a live walk-through of how to develop an algorithm. Each session will have a 1-lecture delay, so topics discussed in Tuesday's lecture will be reinforced in Thursday's workshop; topics discussed in Thursday's lecture will be reinforced in Tuesday's workshop. We will post all associated materials (recordings, slides, documents, etc.) on the course
webpage, including video recordings of each session.

Workshops will be held via [Zoom](https://virginia.zoom.us/j/95047118539).

## Tasks {#tasks}

You will be expected to watch lectures, read the text, and any other provided instructional materials and either understand them or ask questions to clarify what you found confusing. We strongly recommend forming study groups that meet at least weekly all semester long to discuss course concepts, as even if they appear simple at first they will often contain nuances that will only emerge with conversions.

You will be asked to perform two kinds of evaluations:

- **Quizzes**: open-resource assessments of your understanding of broad course topics. These are intended to verify that you develop and maintain an understanding of the course concepts. These must be completed independently. They will occur after each major unit throughout the semester. You will be alotted up to 3 attempts at each assessment. Only the grade from your last attempt per each assessment is is used in your final grade calculation.
- **Exercises**: homework problems for you to solve. These may require that your design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are to provide opportunities for you to develop working familiarity with course concepts. You are encouraged to work on these with a small work group of up to 5 people (yourself plus 4). We suggest working on the problems in frequent 1-2 hours sessions, rather than trying to "cram" a solution. There is no opportunity for revising/re-attempting exercises (though you are allowed unlimited re-submissions up until the deadline).



# Grading

In February 2019 the CS faculty approved [a definition](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) of what it believe grades mean.
It is our intent to approximate that definition in this course.
As a brief summary,

Letter  Student demonstrated                Recommendation re future courses[^future]
------  ---------------------------         ------------------------------------
A       mastery of all topics               likely to do well
B       competence in significant topics    able to do well with some review
C       sufficient competence               likely to be challenging
D       minimal competence                  unlikely to succeed
F       less than minimal competence        retake this course first

[^future]:
    While there are no regularly-offerred UVA undergraduate courses which list cs4102 as a prerequisite, this recommendation will be mostly relative to a hypothetical follow-on course.

We will consider the grade assigned by the following point-based breakdown to be a **guideline** for the grade earned according to the definitions above.

Letter  Student demonstrated                Requirement for that grade
------  ---------------------------         ------------------------------------
A       mastery of all topics               At least 85% in all units
B       competence in significant topics    At least 75% in all units
C       sufficient competence               At least 68% average across all units
D       minimal competence                  At least 60% average across all units
F       less than minimal competence        average across all units less than 60%


Each unit's grade will be determined by equal weight of Quizzes and Exercises. You grade per unit will be calculated using the following formula:


Task                        Weight  Comments
-------------------------  -------- ----------------------------------------------
Quizzes                     50%     1 per unit, 6 total. You may make up to 2 attempts at each and 3 attempts at any one quiz, with only the last attempt counting toward your unit grade
Exercises                   50%     Approximately 2 per unit, 12 total. Expect roughly 1/3 of effort to be programming exercises, 2/3 will be written (i.e. proof-based). Your excercise score for each unit is determined by the average score on exercises associated with that unit.
Professionalism Penalty    0--100%  Rude behavior toward instructor or classmates, unauthorized homework assistance, contacting TAs when they are not on the clock, etc., can be held against a student when final grades are calculated.

More precisely, your final letter grade will be determined by the following:

You get (CR/GC/NC) if you score                           GPA value
------- ---------- -------------------------------------  ---------
A+      (CR)       near the top                            4.0
A       (CR)       ≥ 85% on all units                      4.0
A−      (CR)       ≥ 83% on all units                      3.7
B+      (CR)       ≥ 80% on all units                      3.3
B       (CR)       ≥ 75% on all units                      3.0
B−      (CR)       ≥ 73% on all units                      2.7
C+      (CR)       ≥ 73% average across units              2.3
C       (CR)       ≥ 68% average across units[^noCminus]   2.0
D+      (GC)       ≥ 63% average across units              1.3
D       (GC)       ≥ 60% average across units              1.0
D−      (GC)       ≥ 58% average across units              0.7
F       (NC)       otherwise                                0.0

[^noCminus]: Since the CS department uses C- as the lower threshold for prerequisites, the university guidelines say that GC cannot be used to satisfy re-requisites, and C- being categorized as GC by the university, we feel the most fair thing to do is to remove the C- level from the grading scale entirely, instead rounding up all C- grades to a C.


**Rounding:** By default, grades will not be rounded in this course.

This numerical calculation is to be considered a **guideline** on your score in the course. Final letter grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials. We expect that qualitative adjustments will only result in a student's grade increasing.

As a warning, since there is a discontinuity in grade calculation (i.e. we go from grades being determined by your lowest unit to your average across all units) it is possible for some of you to see small perturbations in your grading result in a change of up to 2 letter grades. We do not see this as being a likely scenario, but you find yourself in that situation, let us know so we can ensure you're assessed fairly.

## Bonus Points

Bonus points are the main way for you to earn a grade above the mathematical calculation above. These can be earned by excpetional participation in workshops, lecture, or office hours. They can also be earned by engagement with algorithms topics beyond the course expectation. To submit extra credit, please email both of Professors Brunelle and Wu.


## Deadlines

Deadlines for all assignments are available on the [schedule page](schedule.html).

Late submissions of a problem will generally not be accepted. If you feel that extenuating circumstances justify late submission for any assignment, please request a deadline extension. You can do that on the same page where you would submit an assignment. There is no upper bound on the number of assignment extensions you may be granted, but past extensions may influence our decision on whether to grant future extensions. 

## Regrades

We acknowledge that professors and TAs are people, and people make mistakes. For this reason, you are able to request regrades on assignments within 5 days of your grade being returned.

Please only submit a regrade request if you believe the rubric was misapplied to your submission. In your request, identify specifically which rubric item was erroneously assessed, and where in your submission we can find the evidence of this.

# Miscellanea

## Pledge

All students of CS4102 are expected to abide by the [course pledge](pledge.html).

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness (and I have in the past adjusted grades both up and down to reflect this ethos).

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning, and therefore egregiously unprofessional behavior could incur arbitrary penalty to your grade.

## Honesty

I always hope everyone will behave honestly.
I know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

**Quizzes**: You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home assessments. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or linked to from the course webpage
- Your *personal* notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as official accommodation)
- Lecture recordings

**Exercises**: You may collaborate with up to 4 other people (i.e. a group of up to 5 total) when completing exercises. You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- Your write-ups must be done entirely independently. You may not reference the web or any artifacts from your collaborations when writing up your solution/code, and so we expect that the answers you submit be expressed in your own words/implementation. 
- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only. Don't use Chegg.


### Consequences of Dishonesty

If we believe you have acted dishonestly, we will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information we lack, please share that with us; we may thereafter change our beliefs and/or proposed penalty.


## Personal accommodations

### Special Circumstances

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center
(SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting [their website](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class**.

### Religious observances

 It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely
held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to
Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the [University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu
or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of
the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Safe Environment

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning
environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University
hold as critically important:

1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can
be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.
As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand
ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee,
which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the
University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student
receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to
determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are [Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds](https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources). The worst possible
situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able
to help.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
