# What to expect

## In this Algorithms course

In the opinion of this instructor, an algorithms course should serve to:

1. introduce students to particular noteworthy and/or widely-used algorithms, and
1. provide opportunity for students to hone their skill in developing efficient algorithms.

Since developing a skill is a much more substantial undertaking than understanding prior work of others, the majority of your homework time will be spent on developing that skill. This will be at times uncomfortable, occasionally frustrating, but hopefully always fun and valuable in retrospect. I have a few guidelines/suggestions for how you can get the most out of this course:

1. Follow the instructions in the assignments. I've been a student before, and I understand the dizzying experience of learning something brand new. For this reason, I do not ask trick questions that are specifically intended to mislead you. 
1. Think carefully and precisely: While I will not purposefully mislead you, I may ask questions that are specifically designed to challenge an incorrect intuition or common misconception.
1. Don't expect homework to match lecture perfectly: Lecture is designed to introduce topics/concepts/strategies, and show how they operate. To maximize the future usefulness of this course, I selected ideas whose applications are broad. Almost always, I will tell you which ideas to employ. It will probably not be obvious how or why that idea is relevant, but I promise it is. The goal of the assignment is to broaden your understanding of the idea so that it will be more useful to you when you complete this class.


## In a summer course

A typical spring/fall semester at UVA is ~15 weeks long (including exams), whereas a summer course is 4 weeks long. This means that summer courses are accelerated roughly 4x compared to a course offered in the spring/fall. Considering that a full-time courseload at UVA is 12 credit hours, expect a 3 credit-hour course offered during the summer (like this one) to require a full-time workload. Another way to think about it: the amount of time you spend per day on this one summer course should roughly match the aggregate amount of work you would spend per day on all your courses during a normal semester.

As a warning, with this 4x acceleration, it can be very difficult to catch up if you fall behind. Each lecture session this summer is 135 minutes. During a normal semester you have 150 minutes of instruction per week. This means that each summer lecture contains nearly a week's worth of content. Keep this in mind if you need to take a day off due to illness, etc.

Now that I've sufficiently warned you, please take comfort that I have done my best in trying to make this course workable with a summer schedule. The structures have been designed based on extensive student feedback. The most successful students tend to approach this course like a full-time job, establishing a regular work schedule of 9ish hours of work per day (amortized).

## In an online course

As I'm sure you're aware, there are challenges presented by the online course format which can make learning more challenging. If there are things I can do to make the course work better for you with this online format, please let me know, and I'll do my best to work in those recommendations. To start with, here are the resources and suggestions that are provided by the course staff.

Course structures:

1. **Lecture**: will be hosted live online via zoom. Recordings will be posted after (sometimes it takes zoom a few hours to master the video). Due to instances of "zoom bombing", you will need a password to join (find it on piazza)
1. **Office Hours**: There will be instructor and TA office hours 5 days a week hosted via zoom. These will be open chat rooms for you to discuss with course staff and classmates.
1. **Online submissions**: Problem set solutions must be submitted by pdf. Quizzes may be submitted as either a pdf or a txt file. We do not have a preference for how the pdfs are generated (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, pictures of handwriting are all acceptable) so long as what is submitted is legible, and you use the appropriate mathematical symbols when necessary (please use the equation editor if you're using Word).
1. **Piazza**: We will be using the Piazza message board. We highly encourage you to post questions or resources that you think could benefit your peers. This is also the best place to post questions outside of office hours.

Some suggestions:

1. **Dedicate time and space** One of the most important things you can do to help yourself is to set aside time and space for your studies. Once you've selected that time and space, try to only do work at that time and in that location. As much as possible, don't use that time or place for anything else. Pick a chair in your bedroom, a spot on the floor, a chair at the kitchen table, or whatever you can do with the space you're in.
1. **Introduce yourself** If you opt in on the beginning of course questionnaire (little_1a), we will post a short bio about you on the course webpage. This could be helpful in you forming a study/work group for the class. It could also help you to make new friends!
1. **Attend live lecture** If you're able to, attending live lecture will help to establish your routine, put you in the learning mindset, and remind you that you're learning in a community.


# Logistics

## Meetings

Live zoom lectures will be held Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 10:30amâ€“12:45PM

Lecture attendance is optional, but strongly encouraged. In the event you are unable to attend a lecture, recordings of lectures are provided on the [schedule page](schedule.html).


## Contact

|        | Instructor | TAs |

| Location | Rice 209 | TBA |
| Office Hours | TBD | TBA |
| Phone | 243-3845 | (none) |
| Email | <a href="mailto:njb2b@virginia.edu?subject=DMT1">njb2b@virginia.edu</a> | use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/virginia/summer2020/cs4102) |

For communication about course content, [Piazza](https://piazza.com/virginia/summer2020/cs4102) is preferred to email.
For communication about personal circumstances, email or in-person visits are preferred.
If you email, include either "algorithms" or "4102" in the subject line to prevent your email from skipping my inbox and never getting read.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.


## Readings

There is no required textbook for this class. If you would like to consult a text to reinforce your learning, we recommend:

*Introduction to Algorithms*, Third Edition by Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0262033844).
UVA Library makes a digital version of our textbook [available online](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775).

Readings corresponding to each lecture will be posted on the course schedule.


## Lectures

I do my best to make lectures as valuable, engaging, and enlightening as possible for all
students. For a schedule of lecture topics, please see the [course webpage](schedule.html).
Although we believe nearly all students will benefit from attending all classes, we also respect that as
mature (ideally) college students, you are entrusted to figure out how best to learn and
make use of your time here. Hence, I will not assess attendance or impose any penalties for missing
class. 
I will make a best effort to post all lecture materials (recordings, slides documents, etc.) on the course
webpage, including video recordings of lectures. Be advised that there are occasional technical difficulties which sometimes cause the recordings to fail, and even when they do succeed these recordings are not an adequate substitute for
attending class live.



## Tasks {#tasks}

You will be expected to read instructional material and either understand it or ask questions to clarify what you found confusing. We strongly recommend forming study groups that meet at least weekly all semester long to discuss readings, as even if they appear simple at first they will often contain nuances that will only emerge with conversions.

You will be asked to perform three kinds of evaluations:

- **Quizzes**: open-resource assessments of your understanding of broad course topics. These are intended to verify that you develop and maintain an intuitive understanding of the course concepts. These must be completed independently.
- **Little Problem Sets**: problems for you to solve. These may require that your design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are to provide opportunities for you to develop working familiarity with course concepts. You are encouraged to work on these with a small work group of up to 5 people (yourself plus 4). These problem sets are short, and the tasks are more "bit-sized" in that they're expected to be completable in 1-2 sittings.
- **Big Problem Sets**: problems for you to solve. These may require that your design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are to provide opportunities for you exercise and hone your skills with course concepts. You are encouraged to work on these with a small work group of up to 5 people (yourself plus 4). These problem sets are longer, and the tasks typically require deeper insight than those on the little problem sets. You are given longer to do them mostly to allow you time for more sittings. I suggest working on the problems in frequent 1-2 hours sessions, rather than trying to "cram" a solution.



# Grading

In February 2019 the CS faculty approved [a definition](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) of what we believe grades mean.
It is my intent to approximate that definition in this course.
As a brief summary,

Letter  Student demonstrated                Recommendation re future courses[^future]
------  ---------------------------         ------------------------------------
A       mastery of all topics               likely to do well
B       competence in significant topics    able to do well with some review
C       sufficient competence               likely to be challenging
D       minimal competence                  unlikely to succeed
F       less than minimal competence        retake this course first

[^future]:
    While there are no regularly-offerred UVA undergraduate courses which list cs4102 as a prerequisite, this recommendation will be mostly relative to a hypothetical follow-on course.

We will consider the grade assigned by the following point-based breakdown to be a **guideline** for the grade earned according to the definitions above.

Task                        Weight  Comments
-------------------------  -------- ----------------------------------------------
Quizzes                     12%     Due each Friday. There will be 4 total, each worth 3% of your grade
Little Problem sets         48%     Due each Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. There will be 12 total, each worth 4% of your grade
Big Problem sets            40%     Due Each Monday (except the for Big4, which is due on Saturday July 11 in lieue of a final exam). There will be 4 total, each worth 10% of your grade
Professionalism Penalty    0--100%  Excessive missed classes, rude behavior toward instructor or classmates, unauthorized homework assistance, contacting TAs when they are not on the clock, etc., can be held against a student when final grades are calculated.

Your final letter grade will then be assigned as follows:

You get  if you score  GPA value
-------- ------------- ---------
A+       near the top  4.0
A        â‰¥ 93%         4.0
Aâˆ’       â‰¥ 90%         3.7
B+       â‰¥ 86%         3.3
B        â‰¥ 83%         3.0
Bâˆ’       â‰¥ 80%         2.7
C+       â‰¥ 76%         2.3
C        â‰¥ 73%         2.0
Câˆ’       â‰¥ 70%         1.7
D+       â‰¥ 66%         1.3
D        â‰¥ 63%         1.0
Dâˆ’       â‰¥ 60%         0.7
F        otherwise     0.0

**Rounding:** By default, grades will not be rounded in this course.

This numerical calculation is to be considered a **guideline** on your score in the course. Final letter grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials. I expect that qualitative adjustments will only result in a student's grade increasing (though in extreme circumstances I reserve the right to decrease grades).

## Deadlines

Deadlines for all assignments are available on the [schedule page](schedule.html). In general, you will have little assignments due every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, big assignments due Monday, and a quiz every Friday.

Due to the rapid pace of summer courses, late submissions of assignments will not be allowed by default. If you feel that extenuating circumstances justify late submission for any assignment, please request a deadline extension. You can do that on the same page where you would submit an assignment. There is no upper bound on the number of assignment extensions you may be granted, but please don't exploit this. 

## Regrades

We acknowledge that professors and TAs are people, and people make mistakes. For this reason, you are able to request regrades on assignments within 48 hours of your grade being returned.

For **problem sets** (both **big** and **little**), please only submit a regrade request if you believe the rubric was misapplied to your submission. In your request, identify specifically what in your submission demonstrates the misapplication.

The goal of **quizzes** is to help you to form a better conceptual understanding of course materials, and therefore we consider them primarily as an opportunity to identify and correct misconceptions. For this reason, you may submit one regrade request per quiz to revise your answers.

# Miscellanea

## Pledge

All students of CS4102 are expected to abide by the [course pledge](pledge.html).

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness (and I have in the past adjusted grades both up and down to reflect this ethos).

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning, and therefore egregiously unprofessional behavior could incur arbitrary penalty to your grade.

## Honesty

I always hope everyone will behave honestly.
I know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

**Quizzes**: You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture recordings

**Problem Sets**: You may collaborate with up to 4 other people (i.e. a group of up to 5 total) when completing exercises. You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- Your write-ups must be done entirely independently. You may take notes while meeting with your collaborators, but we expect that the answers you submit be expressed in your own words. 
- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.


### Consequences of Dishonesty

If I believe you have acted dishonestly, I will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information I lack, please share that with me; I may thereafter change my belief and/or proposed penalty.


## Personal accommodations

### Special Circumstances

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center
(SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting [their website](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class**.

### Religious observances

 It is the Universityâ€™s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely
held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to
Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the [Universityâ€™s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu
or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of
the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Safe Environment

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning
environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University
hold as critically important:

1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can
be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.
As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand
ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee,
which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the
Universityâ€™s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinatorâ€™s job is to ensure that the reporting student
receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to
determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are [Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible
situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able
to help.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
