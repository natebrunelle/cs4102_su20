For communication about course content, [Piazza](https://piazza.com/virginia/summer2020/cs4102) is preferred to email.
For communication about personal circumstances, email or in-person visits are preferred.
If you email, include either "algorithms" or "4102" in the subject line to prevent your email from skipping my inbox and never getting read.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.


## Readings

There is no required textbook for this class. If you would like to consult a text to reinforce your learning, we recommend:

*Introduction to Algorithms*, Third Edition by Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0262033844).
UVA Library makes a digital version of our textbook [available online](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775).

Readings corresponding to each lecture will be posted on the course schedule.


## Lectures

We do our best to make lectures as valuable, engaging, and enlightening as possible for all
students. For a schedule of lecture topics, please see the [course webpage](schedule.html).
We will post all lecture materials (recordings, slides documents, etc.) on the course
webpage, including video recordings of lectures. Be advised that there are occasional technical difficulties which sometimes cause the recordings to fail, in these situations we will post an equivalent recording from a previous semester.



## Tasks {#tasks}

You will be expected to read instructional material and either understand it or ask questions to clarify what you found confusing. We strongly recommend forming study groups that meet at least weekly all semester long to discuss readings, as even if they appear simple at first they will often contain nuances that will only emerge with conversions.

You will be asked to perform three kinds of evaluations:

- **Assessments**: open-resource assessments of your understanding of broad course topics. These are intended to verify that you develop and maintain an understanding of the course concepts. These must be completed independently.
- **Exercises**: problems for you to solve. These may require that your design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are to provide opportunities for you to develop working familiarity with course concepts. You are encouraged to work on these with a small work group of up to 5 people (yourself plus 4). We suggest working on the problems in frequent 1-2 hours sessions, rather than trying to "cram" a solution.



# Grading

In February 2019 the CS faculty approved [a definition](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) of what it believe grades mean.
It is our intent to approximate that definition in this course.
As a brief summary,

Letter  Student demonstrated                Recommendation re future courses[^future]
------  ---------------------------         ------------------------------------
A       mastery of all topics               likely to do well
B       competence in significant topics    able to do well with some review
C       sufficient competence               likely to be challenging
D       minimal competence                  unlikely to succeed
F       less than minimal competence        retake this course first

[^future]:
    While there are no regularly-offerred UVA undergraduate courses which list cs4102 as a prerequisite, this recommendation will be mostly relative to a hypothetical follow-on course.

We will consider the grade assigned by the following point-based breakdown to be a **guideline** for the grade earned according to the definitions above.

Task                        Weight  Comments
-------------------------  -------- ----------------------------------------------
Assessments                     40%     TBD
Exercises         60%     TBD
Professionalism Penalty    0--100%  Excessive missed classes, rude behavior toward instructor or classmates, unauthorized homework assistance, contacting TAs when they are not on the clock, etc., can be held against a student when final grades are calculated.

Your final letter grade will then be assigned as follows:

You get  if you score  GPA value
-------- ------------- ---------
A+       near the top  4.0
A        ≥ 93%         4.0
A−       ≥ 90%         3.7
B+       ≥ 86%         3.3
B        ≥ 83%         3.0
B−       ≥ 80%         2.7
C+       ≥ 76%         2.3
C        ≥ 73%         2.0
C−       ≥ 70%         1.7
D+       ≥ 66%         1.3
D        ≥ 63%         1.0
D−       ≥ 60%         0.7
F        otherwise     0.0

**Rounding:** By default, grades will not be rounded in this course.

This numerical calculation is to be considered a **guideline** on your score in the course. Final letter grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials. I expect that qualitative adjustments will only result in a student's grade increasing (though in extreme circumstances I reserve the right to decrease grades).

## Deadlines

Deadlines for all assignments are available on the [schedule page](schedule.html). In general, you will have "little" deadlines and "big" deadlines. A small number of problems will be due on the "little" deadline, and the remainder will be due on the "big" deadline

Late submissions of a problem will receive a 20% penalty per 24 hours. If you feel that extenuating circumstances justify late submission for any assignment, please request a deadline extension. You can do that on the same page where you would submit an assignment. There is no upper bound on the number of assignment extensions you may be granted, but please don't exploit this. 

## Regrades

We acknowledge that professors and TAs are people, and people make mistakes. For this reason, you are able to request regrades on assignments within 5 days of your grade being returned.

Please only submit a regrade request if you believe the rubric was misapplied to your submission. In your request, identify specifically what in your submission demonstrates the misapplication.

# Miscellanea

## Pledge

All students of CS4102 are expected to abide by the [course pledge](pledge.html).

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness (and I have in the past adjusted grades both up and down to reflect this ethos).

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning, and therefore egregiously unprofessional behavior could incur arbitrary penalty to your grade.

## Honesty

I always hope everyone will behave honestly.
I know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

**Assessments**: You must complete assessments entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture recordings

**Exercises**: You may collaborate with up to 4 other people (i.e. a group of up to 5 total) when completing exercises. You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- Your write-ups must be done entirely independently. You may take notes while meeting with your collaborators, but we expect that the answers you submit be expressed in your own words. 
- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.


### Consequences of Dishonesty

If we believe you have acted dishonestly, we will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information we lack, please share that with us; we may thereafter change our beliefs and/or proposed penalty.


## Personal accommodations

### Special Circumstances

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center
(SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting [their website](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class**.

### Religious observances

 It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely
held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to
Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the [University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu
or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of
the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Safe Environment

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning
environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University
hold as critically important:

1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can
be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.
As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand
ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee,
which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the
University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student
receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to
determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are [Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible
situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able
to help.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
