title: Python, Java, and LaTeX Setup
...



For the programming assignments this semester you will be required to use either Python3 or Java. For written assignments you will be required to use LaTeX (a document-writing "programming language").
If you already have some version of Python3/Java on your machine and an IDE you're comfortable with (perhaps left over from cs1110 or cs2100), you should be good to go
for the programming assignments. If you need to install, Instructions follow. No downloads are necessary to use LaTeX if you use Overleaf (an online LaTeX environment), and setup instructions follow as well.

# Installing Python3 and PyCharm

Follow these directions to download Python 3.10.6 (the latest stable release as of this writing) and
PyCharm Community Edition 2022.2.1 (you’re welcome to use any IDE that you want, we
semi-arbitrarily picked PyCharm).

## Windows

1.  Install Python 3:
    
    1.  Download [the executable x86-64 installer from python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe).
    
    2.  Run the installer.
    
    3.  Choose the "Custom Installation" option.
    
    4.  If asked, check "Add Python to environment variables" and "Install for all users"; leave all other options at their default values.

2.  Install PyCharm Community Edition:
    
    1.  Download [the executable installer from jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC).
    
    2.  Run the installer.
    
    3.  If asked, check "Create associations" - ".py"; leave all other options at their default values.
    
## Mac OS X

1.  Install Python3:
    
    1.  Download [the installer from python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-macos11.pkg).
    
    2.  Run the installer.
    
    3.  Choose the "Custom Installation" option.
    
    4.  If asked, check "Add Python to environment variables" and "Install for all users"; leave all other options at their default values.

2.  Install PyCharm Community Edition:
    
    1.  Download the dmg disk image from jetbrains.com. [For Intel Processors](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac&code=PCC) [For Apple Silicon Processors](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=macM1&code=PCC).
    
    2.  Drag the icon to the Applications folder.
    

# Installing Java and Eclipse

I recommend that you follow CS2100's [installation instructions](https://markfloryan.github.io/dsa1/homeworks/BasicJava1/power.pdf) (you do not need to complete the Power.java task).

# Register for Overleaf

Visit [https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) and register for an Overleaf account (if you don’t already have one). UVA has a site license to Overleaf, so if you register with your @virginia.edu email address you will have full access to all the Overleaf features for free.

## Setting Up a Repository

For each written problem set you will set up a repository by following these steps:

1. Download the template file from the problem set's page (template files are just .zip files)
1. In Overleaf, click on *Create First Project* or *New Project in Overleaf* and select *Upload Project* from the menu.
1. Click *Select a .zip file* then select the file you downloaded in step 1
