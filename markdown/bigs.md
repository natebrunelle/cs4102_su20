title: Big Problem sets
...

All "Big" problem sets will be posted here as they are released (at least 5 days before the deadline).

# Instructions

Big problem sets are due every Monday. These problems are typically more challenging, so I recommend you start them early. In my experience with solving tricky problems, it is more productive to work on them in short bursts, with breaks in between. To solve a hard problem, it's less about the number of hours you spend working on it than it is about the number of showers.

# Policies

You may collaborate with up to 4 other people (i.e. a group of up to 5 total) when completing exercises. You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- Your write-ups must be done entirely independently. You may take notes while meeting with your collaborators, but we expect that the answers you submit be expressed in your own words. 
- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.

# Deliverables

Unless otherwise indicated, each problem set will be submitted as a pdf on the [Assignments page](https://www.kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cs4102). We do not have a preference for how the pdfs are generated (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, pictures of handwriting are all acceptable) so long as what is submitted is legible, and you use the appropriate mathematical symbols when necessary (please use the equation editor if you're using Word).

# Problem Sets

## Big 1

Due 11:59pm Tuesday June 23. 

This assignment is intended to give you experience with the design and analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms. The problems will derive from content learned during the first week of lecture.

Please answer the questions on [this worksheet](files/bigs/big1_blank.pdf) ([tex source](files/bigs/big1_su2020.zip)). Submit your answers as a pdf.

## Big 2

Due 11:59pm Monday June 29. 

This assignment is intended to give you experience with designing and modifying sorting algorithms and dynamic programming. The problems will derive from content learned during the second week of lecture.

Please answer the questions on [this worksheet](files/bigs/big2_blank.pdf) ([tex source](files/bigs/big2_su2020.zip)). Submit your answers as a pdf.

## Big 3

Due 11:59pm Tuesday July 7. 

This assignment is intended to give you experience with designing and modifying greedy algorithms and graph algorithms. The problems will derive from content learned during the third week of lecture

Please answer the questions on [this worksheet](files/bigs/big3_blank.pdf) ([tex source](files/bigs/big3_su2020.zip)). Submit your answers as a pdf.

## Big 4

Due 11:59pm Saturday July 11. 

This assignment is intended to give you experience with reductions, and you should use reductions on all problems.

Please answer problem 1 and your choice from problems 2 and 3 presented in [this worksheet](files/bigs/big4_blank.pdf) ([tex source](files/bigs/big4_su2020.zip)). Submit your answers as a pdf.
