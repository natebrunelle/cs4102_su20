# The course is full, will more seats be added?

I have no upper bound on course size, but I do have an upper bound on the ratio of students to course staff, as this has a major impact on the timeliness of help, feedback, and grading. Timeliness is especially important for summer courses, since they're accelerated compared to a typical semester. 

I will add seats so long as I am permitted and able to recruit TAs to keep the ratio sufficiently small. If your interested in enrolling in the class then the best thing to do is to join the waiting list. This will signal to me the number of additional people who intend to enroll, so I know to recruit additional TAs.

# The course is listed as online synchronous, must I be available during the meeting times?

My current plan (and I'm still working out the details) is to hold and record synchronous lectures during the official meeting times. This means that if you are unable to attend the meeting times you will still be able to catch up by viewing the recording. There will be no traditional exams for this course.

That being said, I hope to introduce a robust groupwork component for the summer. This would be strongly encouraged but optional. If you opt in, you will be assigned to a group of roughly 6 students, and you will be permitted to compose a collaborative solution to most assignments (but not all). These groups would meet at a time outside of the official SIS meeting time.

In summary, you don't need to be available at the time listed in SIS, but you will have the best experience in the course if you're able to find some similarly-sized block of time available each day.

# Am I able to take more than one course in a single summer session?

There is no policy which prevents you from doing this, but I strongly discourage it. Consider this. A summer course meets for about 4 weeks. A typical semester lasts about 14 weeks. This means that a summer course is accelerated by almost 4 times a normal semester. If you are taking one 3 credit course over the summer, and that course is accelerated by 4 times, then the weekly workload and content coverage by that one course roughly matches that from *all* courses during a normal 12-credit hour semester. Taking two summer courses is like taking 24 credits during the spring/fall.

# I heard that due to COVID, students can take a summer course for free. How's that work?

As long as you did not earn more than 33 credits in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, and that course is offerred during session 1 (which this one is!), then your enrollement is free of charge.

# Really, we're meeting on Saturday?!

Yes, session 1 will meet during two Saturdays: June 5 and Jun 12.
