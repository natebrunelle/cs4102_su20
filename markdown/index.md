I have no upper bound on course size, but I do have an upper bound on the ratio of students to course staff, as this has a major impact on the timeliness of help, feedback, and grading. Timeliness is especially important for summer courses, since they're accelerated compared to a typical semester. 

I will add seats so long as I am permitted and able to recruit TAs to keep the ratio sufficiently small. If your interested in enrolling in the class then the best thing to do is to join the waiting list. This will signal to me the number of additional people who intend to enroll, so I know to recruit additional TAs.

My current plan (and I'm still working out the details) is to hold and record synchronous lectures during the official meeting times. This means that if you are unable to attend the meeting times you will still be able to catch up by viewing the recording. There will be no traditional exams for this course.

That being said, I hope to introduce a robust groupwork component for the summer. This would be strongly encouraged but optional. If you opt in, you will be assigned to a group of roughly 6 students, and you will be permitted to compose a collaborative solution to most assignments (but not all). These groups would meet at a time outside of the official SIS meeting time.

In summary, you don't need to be available at the time listed in SIS, but you will have the best experience in the course if you're able to find some similarly-sized block of time available each day.
=======
- Analyze a pre-written algorithm to determine its resource complexity
- Employ the strategies of divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming (perhaps in concert) to develop novel algorithms
- Prove the correctness of algorithms built using these strategies
- Identify trade-offs in algorithm design (such as time vs. space, average-case vs. worst case, dynamic vs. static)
- Prove lower bounds on algorithm complexity

- Trees ([CS2150 trees](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/05-trees.html#/))
- Queues ([CS2150 lists](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/02-lists.html#/))
- Stacks ([CS2150 lists](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/02-lists.html#/))
- Priority Queues ([CS2150 Heaps](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/10-heaps-huffman.html#/cover))
- Hash Tables ([CS2150 Hashing](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/06-hashes.html#/cover))
- Graphs ([CS2150 Graphs](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/11-graphs.html#/cover))

For each of the CS2102 topics, you can view last [semester's lectures](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/DMT1/S2020/schedule.html) for more information

## Course Structure

You will see the following components in this course this semester. Look in the syllabus for the details on each:

- **Lectures**: Introduces new concepts, we expect all students to participate/view lectures
- **Workshops**: Gives additional examples and deeper discussions of topics discussed in lecture, this is optional for all students, but you may find it helpful
- **Exercises**: Collaborative work to develop your skills with course concepts
- **Quizzes**: Individual work to evaluate your fluency with course concepts
- **Office Hours**: Opportunity for individualized assistance with course concepts
- **Piazza**: A forum to ask questions that you think might be valuable for other students to see answered, that could be answered by other students, or that you prefer to ask outside of an office-hours/lecture environment.



# What to expect

## In this course

In the opinion of the course staff, an algorithms course should serve to:

1. introduce students to particular noteworthy and/or widely-used algorithms, and
1. provide opportunity for students to hone their skill in developing efficient algorithms.

Since developing a skill is a much more substantial undertaking than understanding prior work of others, the majority of your homework time will be spent on developing that skill. This will be at times uncomfortable, occasionally frustrating, but hopefully always fun and valuable (at least in retrospect). We have a few guidelines/suggestions for how you can get the most out of this course:

1. Follow the instructions in the assignments. The instructors have been students before, and understand the dizzying experience of learning something brand new. For this reason, we do not ask trick questions that are specifically intended to mislead you. 
1. Think carefully and precisely: While we will not purposefully mislead you, we may ask questions that are specifically designed to challenge an incorrect intuition or common misconception.
1. Don't expect homework to match lecture perfectly: Lecture is designed to introduce topics/concepts/strategies, and show how they operate. To maximize the future usefulness of this course, the course covers ideas whose applications are broad. Almost always, the homework directions will tell you which ideas to employ. It will probably not be obvious how or why that idea is relevant, but we promise it is. The goal of the assignment is to broaden your understanding of the idea so that it will be more useful to you when you complete this class.




## In an online course

As you're likely aware, there are challenges presented by the online course format which can make learning more challenging. If there are things we can do to make the course work better for you with this online format, please let us know, and we'll do our best to work in those recommendations. 

We have also provided some suggestions for how you can best set yourself up for learning in this course as well as others:

1. **Dedicate time and space** One of the most important things you can do to help yourself is to set aside time and space for your studies. Once you've selected that time and space, try to only do work at that time and in that location. As much as possible, don't use that time or place for anything else. Pick a chair in your bedroom, a spot on the floor, a chair at the kitchen table, or whatever you can do with the space you're in.
1. **Introduce yourself** Come to office hours, turn on your video, and introduce yourself to your classmates. This could be helpful in you forming a study/work group for the class. It could also help you to make new friends!
1. **Attend live meetings** If you're able to, attending live lectures and problem-solving-sessions will help to establish your routine, put you in the learning mindset, and remind you that you're learning in a community. If you're not able to attend live lecture, then try to view the lecture at the same time every day, and please ask questions about lecture on piazza to (at least somewhat) mimic the interactions present in a live setting.
1. **Be active** You likely moved around outside a lot when you were transitioning among your classrooms, dorms, libraries, and dining areas. Try your best to mimic that frequent activity, as it helps you to kind of "refresh" for the next task. Take several short walks a day (don't forget your mask), do yoga, hop on a stationary bike, do whatever activity most appeals to you.

# Am I able to take more than one course in a single summer session?

There is no policy which prevents you from doing this, but I strongly discourage it. Consider this. A summer course meets for about 4 weeks. A typical semester lasts about 14 weeks. This means that a summer course is accelerated by almost 4 times a normal semester. If you are taking one 3 credit course over the summer, and that course is accelerated by 4 times, then the weekly workload and content coverage by that one course roughly matches that from *all* courses during a normal 12-credit hour semester. Taking two summer courses is like taking 24 credits during the spring/fall.

# I heard that due to COVID, students can take a summer course for free. How's that work?

As long as you did not earn more than 33 credits in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, and that course is offerred during session 1 (which this one is!), then your enrollement is free of charge.

# Really, we're meeting on Saturday?!

Yes, session 1 will meet during two Saturdays: June 5 and Jun 12.
