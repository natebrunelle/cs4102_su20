# Extensions

To request an extension on an assignmnet, please complete this [Extension Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKmoO7gv7weKcSshIxloepFePQzOEk99qtgGdh-omvKEUbmw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Whenever possible, please submit your extension requests at least 24 hours in advance of the assignment deadline (though we understand if you the circumstance that prevents you from submitting on time also prevents you from submitting the extension request ahead of time). Almost every "short" extension is granted. 

If you are submitting as a group then only one member of your group needs to submit the request (and that member must be the one to submit).

# Written Problem Sets

You are welcome to work on and submit written problem sets in groups. If you form your own group then just name all group members in gradescope after you submit. If you don't know already who you'd like to work with then you can either use the `#find-a-team` channel in Discord, or else complete the [Random Team Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHNVL79Np4hWT1_Uwy_Uy5Pwu1r4d_mQL9cRTYjdIbmThcTg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to be randomly assigned to a team. Teams may be formed across sections of the course.
