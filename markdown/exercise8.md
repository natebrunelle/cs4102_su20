title: Exercise 7 NP or not NP?
...


# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to give practice with polynomial reductions, the definitions of P and NP, and running time of Turing Machines



# Exercises 8-1 through 8-4 Written problems.

Answer the problems contained in [this pdf](/files/exercises/exercise8.pdf) with an accompanying proof (unless stated otherwise).

To begin, download [exercise7.zip](/files/exercises/exercise8.zip) and upload as a new project in overleaf. Within that zip you will see 4 tex files. the `exercise7.tex` file contains the code which generates the pdf, and `exercise8_1.tex`, `exercise8_2.tex`, `exercise8_3.tex`, and `exercise8_4.tex` are where you will provide each answer.

First, change `\submitter{TODO: your name}` in `exercise8.tex` to contain your name and UVA email id (e.g. `\submitter{Grace Hopper (gmh1a)}`)

Next, cite all your sources in `\collaborators{TODO: replace ...}` according to the [course policy](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/s2020/syllabus.html#no-plagiarism-nor-anything-like-it)

At this point, fill in your solution in the appropriate tex file. When you rebuild the pdf, your solutions should appear as you write them.


## Deliverable

At the very top of `exercise8.tex` there is a line which reads `\usepackage{uvatoc}`. That line tells LaTeX include everything in the pdf. To include only your solution, comment that line out and uncomment (one at a time) `\usepackage[response1]{uvatoc}`, `\usepackage[response2]{uvatoc}`, `\usepackage[response3]{uvatoc}`, and `\usepackage[response4]{uvatoc}` to build a pdf with only exercise 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, or 8-4 (respectively).

Rename the pdf files and submit to the [assignments page](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory).
