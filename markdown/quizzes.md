All quizzes will be posted here as they are released (by 5pm on the Monday before each deadline).

# Instructions

Quizzes are designed to assess your understanding of course concepts. Each one is worth 50% of the grade in each unit. You may re-attempt each quiz once, with the last grade being used in your grade calculations. You will have the opportunity to re-re-attempt any one quiz at the very end of the semester (details on logistics will be posted as the semester comes to a close).

To ensure readability, quizzes must be typeset using LaTeX

# Policies

You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or directly linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture/workshop recordings

You may contact the course staff through discord, piazza, or office hours for clarification questions.

You will be asked to pledge on each quiz that you've observed these directives.

# Deliverables

Quizzes may be submitted as a pdf file generated using LaTeX.

## Divide and Conquer

This quiz is evaluating your ability to use the Divide and Conquer paradigm for algorithm design to solve a novel problem. You will be expected to solve a given problem using a Divide and Conquer algorithm of your own design, and then you will be asked to demonstrate correctness of you algorithm and that it has the desired running time. 

You may additionally be asked to answer a small number of other questions related to Divide and Conquer.
