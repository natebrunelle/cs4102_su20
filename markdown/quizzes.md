All quizzes will be posted here as they are released (by 5pm on the Thursday before each deadline).

# Instructions

Quizzes are designed to assess your understanding of course concepts and your fluency with the vocabulary introduced. Ideally, if you've been following the class, quizzes should not require very much time. If there is a gap in understanding somewhere, then the quiz should expose that gap, and the time spent filling it in will be time saved when working on subsequent problem sets.

# Policies

You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or directly linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture/workshop recordings

You may contact the course staff through discord or office hours for clarification questions.

You will be asked to pledge on each quiz that you've observed these directives.

After grades are returned, you may submit a regrade request containing revised answers for up to full credit back on the quiz.

# Deliverables

Quizzes may be submitted as a pdf file or a text file.
