title: Quizzes
...

All quizzes will be posted here as they are released (by end of day Thursday before each deadline).

# Instructions

Quizzes are designed to assess your understanding of course concepts. Each one is worth 50% of the grade in each unit. You may re-attempt each quiz once, with the last grade being used in your grade calculations. You will have the opportunity to re-re-attempt any one quiz at the very end of the semester.

# Policies

You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture/workshop recordings
