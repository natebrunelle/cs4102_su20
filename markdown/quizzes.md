...

All quizzes will be posted here as they are released (at least 34 hours before the deadline).

# Instructions

Quizzes are designed to evaluate your intuitive understanding of course concepts, and you fluency with the vocabulary introduced. Ideally, if you've been following along in class, quizzes should not require very much time at all. If there is a gap in understanding somewhere, then the quiz should expose that gap, and the time spend filling it in will be time saved when working on subsequent problem sets.

# Policies

You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture recordings

# Deliverables

Quizzes may be submitted as either a pdf or a txt file. We do not have a preference for how the pdfs are generated (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, pictures of handwriting are all acceptable) so long as what is submitted is legible, and you use the appropriate mathematical symbols when necessary (please use the equation editor if you're using Word).
