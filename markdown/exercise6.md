title: Exercise 6 Heavy Machienr
...


# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to help you to distinguish and demonstrate what problems that are vs. are not computable.



# Exercises 6-1 through 6-5 Written problems.

Answer the problem contained in [this pdf](/files/exercises/exercise6.pdf) with an accompanying proof (unless stated otherwise).

To begin, download [exercise6.zip](/files/exercises/exercise6.zip) and upload as a new project in overleaf. Within that zip you will see 6 tex files. the `exercise6.tex` file contains the code which generates the pdf, and `exercise6_1.tex`, `exercise6_2.tex`, etc is where you will provide each answer.

First, change `\submitter{TODO: your name}` in `exercise6.tex` to contain your name and UVA email id (e.g. `\submitter{Grace Hopper (gmh1a)}`)

Next, cite all your sources in `\collaborators{TODO: replace ...}` according to the [course policy](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/s2020/syllabus.html#no-plagiarism-nor-anything-like-it)

At this point, fill in your solution in the appropriate tex file. When you rebuild the pdf, your solutions should appear as you write them.


## Deliverable

At the very top of `exercise6.tex` there is a line which reads `\usepackage{uvatoc}`. That line tells LaTeX include everything in the pdf. To include only your solution, comment that line out and uncomment `\usepackage[response1]{uvatoc}`, `\usepackage[response2]{uvatoc}`, etc. to build a pdf with only exercise 6-1, 6-2, etc. (respectively).

Rename the pdf files and submit to the [assignments page](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory).
