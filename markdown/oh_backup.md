If I'm engaged with another individual, don't just wait silently in the hall; ask me if you can come in and join the other student(s) there (often the answer will be yes, and even if no I'll know you are waiting).

{.example ...} How to get help from a professor

1. Find when a professor is free
2. Go to that professor's office
3. Come inside, or if it is full make sure the professor knows you are there and are waiting
