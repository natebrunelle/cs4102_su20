title: Office Hours
...

We will be conducting instructor office hours via [Zoom](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=65496792dbce6384a6ddc19115961912). To get started, please create a Zoom account and install a zoom client.

We will have scheduled office hours times. If you have questions outside of office hours, please use the [course piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k5e7rb8cjk23ml).


**Professor offices hours** will be held via zoom. Simply join and hang out during office hours!

**TA office hours** Will be conducted over discord. Please read these rules carefully before attending your first office hours:

1. This server is for instructional use of the TAs and help with Algorithms in Fall of 2020. Anything that is irrelevant to the class should not be talked about on this channel. Please make your username something that is identifiable as you personally (i.e. it should resemble your name).
1. Once you join our server you will be able to connect to the "Student Discussion Room" voice channels. You can use these to chat about problems with other students. We're going to leave it up to the community to determine how to best use those.
1. If you join during office hours and would like TA help, please also put the question/problem you'd like to discuss in "#help-queue". This Channel will be used as a queue. Students can be pulled out of the middle of the queue so that the TA can work with several students at a time. Posts made more than 15 minutes before the current office hours will be assumed to be carry-over from the previous session, and therefore will be ignored.
1. We will be using Discord's Streaming feature. To use this just click on the name of the TA helping you and you can open the stream. This won't work unless you are in the same voice channel as the TA. We also have discovered that Firefox and Safari have trouble with this feature when running discord through the browser. So to access that feature use Chrome or the Discord Client. 
1. This Discord server is replacing face to face Office Hours. If you have a question that you would put into text and get a text response, please put it on Piazza rather than #general or #help-queue. That way others don't have to look in multiple places to see if their question has been answered. 
1. TAs will usually work with single students or small groups. If there is a single problem stumping lots of students a TA might enter a "TA Lecture" channel and give a lecture. 
1. We are figuring things out. If there is a feature you want or confusion you have you can put it in the general chat and we will see if we can address it. 
1. You may DM a TA or make a piazza post with any other questions you may have. You can also put them in #general .
