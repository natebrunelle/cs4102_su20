# Instructions

So, let's be real, this whole "online courses" thing pretty much sucks. I know office hours are awkward. It's harder to get in touch with your professors (when so many things that were once quick in-person conversations are suddenly now email threads, there is huge overhead in context switching and management of the quantity of emails). It's harder to maintain motivation. You don't have classmates to bounce ideas off of. There's less camaraderie among the university community. I could go on...

The good news -- it appears to have been worth it. The models originally assumed that roughly 50% of people would totally ignore the advice and carry on close to normal. The reality has been that our society has understood the gravity of the situation, and many more people have recognized their responsibility in managing the threat. As a result, [Dr. Fauci has modified his original expectation](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/492007-fauci-us-death-toll-looks-more-like-60000-than-100-200k-estimate) of 100,000-200,000 deaths from COVID-19 down to 60,000.

So, I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you.

Thank you for putting up with the uncertainty for how this course and others might work online.  Thank you for social distancing and quarantining. Thank you for sacrificing some of your college experience. Thank you for the jokes, the teasing, and the memes to keep everything light. Thank you for learning. Thank you for any of the acts of kindness you might be performing in your communities. Thank you for saving lives.

Our work isn't done yet. That 60,000 estimate could very easily jump back up if people become restless and stop heding the professional advice. That 60,000 estimate could also go down even more if people continue taking the advice seriously. But, I don't want to diminish our amazing achievement. Because you don't have a graduation this year, because you can't go to Foxfields, because you're not standing in line at Roots, because you aren't picnicing on the lawn, we as a society have saved 40,000 lives.

# Deliverable

Wherever you are stuck, you deserve for that place to be beautiful. Take the time to do something to make your current environment just a little more beautiful.

Some suggestions:

- Hang a picture that you love
- Put away that basket of clean clothes in the corner
- Vacuum
- Dust
- Do something to make a loved one smile
- Change a lightbulb
- Do a craft
- Plant a garden
- Alphabetize something
- Deliver (sanitized) encouragements to your neighbors

You don't need to tell me what you did, but if you want to share then I'd love to hear it.
