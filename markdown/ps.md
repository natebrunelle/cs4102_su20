title: Written Problem Sets
...

All problem sets will be posted here as they are released.

# Instructions

Written problem sets are typically due on alternate Tuesdays (see the course schedule for exceptions). Problem sets should be submitted as a pdf generated by editing the provided LaTeX templates. For each problem set, follow these steps to submit:
1. Solve the problems.
2. Download the zip file containing the LaTeX template.
3. Reupload the template as a new project to Overleaf.
5. Add your solutions into the appropriate tex files.
6. Comment out the `\usepackage{algo}` line in the `psX.tex` file, then uncomment `\usepackage[response]{algo}`.
7. Downlod the pdf and submit to overleaf **Be sure to identify which page each problem appears on when you submit to gradescope!**.
8. Identify your teammates in overleaf if you worked in a team.

# Policies

There are two ways you may attempt the problem set: with a group of up to 6 (you plus 5) or else as a whiteboard-only collaboration with up to 3 (you plus 2).

To form a group you could either select your own members and then upload a group submission to gradescope, or else complete this [Random Teammate Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHNVL79Np4hWT1_Uwy_Uy5Pwu1r4d_mQL9cRTYjdIbmThcTg/viewform?usp=sf_link) so I can assign one for you.
