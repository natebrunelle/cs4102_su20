title: Programming Assignments
...

All programming assignments will be posted here as they are released.

# Instructions

Programming assignments are typically due on Thursdays (see the course schedule for exceptions). With the exception of ps0, all programming assignments may be completed in either Java or Python3 (your choice).

# Policies

You may collaborate with up to 2 other people (i.e. a group of up to 3 total) when completing programming assignments, but your collaboration must be [Whiteboard Only](/syllabus.html) You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.

# Deliverables

Unless otherwise indicated, each program (either a .py file or a .java file) will be submitted in Gradescope. 

# Assignments

## PA0: Getting Started

Due 11:59pm Thursday Jan 26 (but will remain open for submission until Thursday Feb 2).

This assignment is intended to get you set up for future written and programming assignments. Here is a link to the [PA0 Task Description](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cs3100/s2023/pa0.html).

Unlike with all future PAs, you may work and submit as a group of up to 5 on this assignment.

## PA1: Kidney Donation

Due 11:59pm Thursday Feb 2. <span style="color: red;">My Gradescope autograder is broken, so submissions are not live right now. I'll update you when I've fixed it. Sorry!</span>
